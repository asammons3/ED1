<h1>3D Car Reflection</h1>
<p>Avery Sammons</p>
<p><i> This is a reflection on the work I did with 3D modeling </i></p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
	<ul>
<li> Car designed as an intersection of three forms </li>
<li> Design car in a 1:1 ratio </li>
<li> Size accuracy ±1% </li>
<li> Design is exported as stl </li>
<li> Student orients model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material </li>
<li> File is exported as a gcode </li>
<li> Final design is shared out as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage </li>
	</ul>



<h3>Steps</h3>

<figure>
<p><i> Drawing: </i></p>

	<ul>
<li> Draw car to scale as an Engineering Drawing </li>
<li> Scan or photograph drawing </li>
<li> Capture Screenshots of each plane slide</li>
	</ul>
<p><i>3D Modeling: </i></p>
	<ul>
<li> Draw each profile on each plane side </li>
<li> Using the extrusion tool, remove the negative spaces from the 3D form </li>
<li> Use extrusion and fillet tools for finish details</li>
<li> Export STL file</li>
	</ul>
<p><i>Slicing and Printing: </i></p>
	<ul>
<li> Import design to Cura (make any final changes, position 3D model on build plate, setting to .6mm nozzle) </li>
<li> Export as a GCODE file </li>
<li> Print model</li>
	</ul>
<p><i>Documentation: </i></p>
	<ul>
<li> CAD drawing with margin of error analysis </li>
<li> Import design into Modelo to make a 3D model </li>
<li> Reflection will be a HTML document with blurb and 3D render</li>
<li> Add photo of car next to model into Slide Deck</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Process</h3>
<figure>
<p>I chose the hot wheels van to model my car after. First I took dimensions of my car in order to make proper measurements for my car. These measurements are on my Engineering drawing, which also outlines how my car will be removed from a cube. Next, I went into onshape and created a rectangle based on those measurements. After that, I made exact screenshots and placed them respectively on the rectangles. Then I pen tooled around the lines of this measurement in order to be able to hide the picture and still have the markings. After much extruding of negative space, the rectangle finally looked like the shape of my car. Next I added fillets and wheels in order to make my car fancier. Finally I transferred my car design to Cura in order to make final adjustments and get it ready for the laser cutter. Below I have attached images of my process.</p>

<h3>Setbacks and Solutions</h3>
<figure> 

<p>One setback I had during this project was that I wanted windows placed equally on both sides of the car, but I did not want to extrude all the way through because then there would be a hole in the middle. To solve this issue, I used the boolean tool to push the drawing of the windows through to the other side of the car. After that, I pen tooled around the image on the other side of the car. Then I removed the boolean tool so I was just left with the pen tool and then I extruded it. Another setback I had was I did not know how to make the wheels of my car so that they did not go all the way through as tubes on the bottom of my car. To solve this setback, I outlined a rectangle on the bottom of my car, using the mirror tool to ensure that the wheels were all the same width. From there I extruded the rectangle out of the cylinder wheel making it sit flat to the bottom of my car.</p>
